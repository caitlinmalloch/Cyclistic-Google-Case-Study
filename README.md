# Cyclistic-Google-Case-Study
Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Case Study

This is a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. In this case study, I will use R to clean, process and analyze the dataset for a bike share 
company, Cyclistic. 

Please check out the notebook file first to see the final case study, or the R Script for my code. 

Cheers!
